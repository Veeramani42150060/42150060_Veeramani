            <P> 
                Tokyo,officially the Tokyo Metropolis,is the capital of Japan and one of the most populous cities in the world, with a population of over 14 million residents within the city proper as of 2023. The Greater Tokyo Area, which includes Tokyo and parts of six neighboring prefectures, is the most-populous metropolitan area in the world, with 41 million residents as of 2024.
            </P>
            <p> Located at the head of Tokyo Bay, Tokyo is part of the Kant≈ç region on the central coast of Honshu, Japan's largest island. Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan. 
                The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers Tokyo's central 23 special wards (which formerly made up Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands. Despite most of the world recognizing Tokyo as a city, since 1943 its governing structure has been more akin to a prefecture, with an accompanying Governor and Assembly taking precedence over the smaller municipal governments which make up the metropolis.
                 Notable special wards in Tokyo include Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace; 
                Shinjuku, the city's administrative center; and Shibuya, a commercial, cultural, and business hub in the city.

                    The lyrics to "Tokiyo" are forward-facing with a message of time passing without meaning, matched by the song's 
                    
                    fast melody, according to analysis from reviewers at CDJournal.[3] Mori at Real Sound held a similar interpretation, 
                    analyzing the line "Toki yo, bokura nosete" / "Tsuzuiteku, imi mo naku" ("Time goes on, moving us forward" / "Without meaning") as a comparison
                     of the lack of particular deep meaning in life to the reasonless passing of time.[14] Sadahiro noted the lyrics' allusion to
                      the four seasons and felt that the final line of "bye-bye!" contrasted to earlier lyrics such as "Ugoki dase, hari o mawase" / 
                      
                      
                      "Tsugi no kimi ni tsungare" ("Move and rotate the hands of the clock" / "So that it will lead to your next self"). 
                      
                      The song connects to "Friend Ship", the final song on Yellow Dancer, which reintroduces an oriental sound with focus on
                       a synthesizer.Sadahiro noted a lyrical connection between the tracks, with "bye-bye!" matching to "Itsuka mata aeru kana"
                     ("Maybe we will meet again someday"), the final line on "Friend Ship

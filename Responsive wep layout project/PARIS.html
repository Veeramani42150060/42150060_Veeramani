            <P> 
                Paris (French pronunciation: [paʁi] ⓘ) is the capital and largest city of France. With an official estimated population of 2,102,650 residents in January 2023in an area of more than 105 km2 (41 sq mi), Paris is the fourth-largest city in the European Union and the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2022.[6] Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, and gastronomy. For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and extensive system of street lighting, in the 19th century, 
                it became known as the City of Light.
            </P>
            <p> Paris is known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre received 8.9 million visitors in 2023, 
                on track for keeping its position as the most-visited art museum in the world. The Musée d'Orsay, Musée
                 Marmottan Monet and Musée de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. 
                 The Pompidou Centre, Musée National d'Art Moderne, Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso are noted for their collections
                  of modern and contemporary art. The historical district along the Seine in the city centre has been classified as a 
                UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991.
